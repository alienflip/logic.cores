Reverse engineering a circuit from a truth table involves determining the Boolean expressions that describe the circuit’s logic and then implementing the circuit using logic gates. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### **Step 1: Construct the Boolean Expression**
1. **Analyze the Truth Table:**  
   - Identify the input variables (e.g., A, B, C) and the output column.
   - Look at the rows where the output is **1** (these represent minterms for the Sum of Products (SOP) form).
   - Alternatively, look at rows where the output is **0** (these represent maxterms for the Product of Sums (POS) form).

2. **Write the Sum of Products (SOP) Form:**  
   - For each row where the output is **1**, write a minterm (AND of input variables, in their true or complemented form).  
   - Example: If a row has \( A = 0, B = 1, C = 1 \) and Output = 1, the minterm is \( \overline{A}BC \).
   - Combine all minterms with OR (+) to form the expression.

3. **Alternatively, Write the Product of Sums (POS) Form:**  
   - For each row where the output is **0**, write a maxterm (OR of input variables, in their true or complemented form).
   - Example: If a row has \( A = 1, B = 0, C = 1 \) and Output = 0, the maxterm is \( (A + \overline{B} + C) \).
   - Combine all maxterms with AND (•) to form the expression.

4. **Simplify the Expression (Optional):**  
   - Use Boolean algebra rules or Karnaugh maps (K-maps) to simplify the expression for fewer logic gates.

### **Step 2: Draw the Logic Circuit**
1. **Identify the Required Gates:**  
   - Use AND gates for product terms.
   - Use OR gates for sum operations.
   - Use NOT gates for negated variables.

2. **Connect the Gates:**  
   - Implement the simplified Boolean expression using logic gates.
   - If using SOP, use AND gates for minterms, then an OR gate.
   - If using POS, use OR gates for maxterms, then an AND gate.

3. **Verify the Circuit:**  
   - Compare the circuit’s output with the original truth table to ensure correctness.

### **Example**
#### **Given Truth Table**
| A | B | C | Output |
|---|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0      |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1      |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1      |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1      |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0      |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1      |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1      |

#### **Step 1: Find the SOP Expression**
Output = 1 for minterms (0,1, 0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1).  
So the SOP form is:  
\[
\overline{A}BC + \overline{A}B\overline{C} + AB\overline{C} + ABC
\]

#### **Step 2: Draw the Circuit**
1. Use NOT gates to generate \(\overline{A}\), \(\overline{B}\), and \(\overline{C}\).
2. Use AND gates to generate each minterm.
3. Use OR gates to sum the minterms.
